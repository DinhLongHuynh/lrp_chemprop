# OPTIMIZING TRAINING SETTING FOR EXPLAINABLE CHEMPROP MODEL USING LAYER-WISE RELEVANCE PROPAGATION

## About this project
Hello, this repository showcases the work for my Master's Thesis at Uppsala University under the supervision of Dr. Christian Sk√∂ld. The project's goal is to investigate the optimal training settings for an explainable ChemProp model. It utilizes Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) as an explainable AI method within the Directed Message Passing Neural Network architecture. This repository contains all the code used to implement LRP and build the evaluation framework.

## Features
- Implementation of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for Chemprop - Message Passing Neural Networks.
- Visualization tools for atom/bond contribution analysis.
- Evaluation framework for faithfulness and correctness of explanations.
