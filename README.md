# OPTIMIZING TRAINING SETTING FOR EXPLAINABLE CHEMPROP MODEL USING LAYER-WISE RELEVANCE PROPAGATION

## About this project
Hello, this repository showcases the work for my Master's Thesis. The project's goal is to investigate the optimal training settings for an explainable ChemProp model. It utilizes Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) as an explainable AI method within the Directed Message Passing Neural Network architecture. This repository contains all the code used to implement LRP and build the evaluation framework.
