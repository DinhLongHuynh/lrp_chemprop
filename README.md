# OPTIMIZING TRAINING SETTING FOR EXPLAINABLE CHEMPROP MODEL USING LAYER-WISE RELEVANCE PROPAGATION
Hi, this repository demonstrates the work for my Master's Thesis. The project aims to investigate the optimal training setting for an explainable chemprop model. The project used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) as an explainable AI method for Directed-Message Passing Neural Nerwork architecture. This repository contains all the code that use to implement LRP and construct the evaluation framework.
