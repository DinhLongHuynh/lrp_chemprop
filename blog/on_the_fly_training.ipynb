    "This notebook illustrates the use of torch.utils.data.IterableDataset in order to sequentially load the dataset and handle it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** I want to train a ChemProp model using a dataset of 1 million compounds. While this is not an excessively large dataset, my MacBook M1 with 8GB of RAM struggles to process the entire CSV file into MolecularDatapoints. The system works fine with the CSV file, but struggles with the MolecularDatapoints. As a result, I am looking for an alternative approach to load small subsets of the CSV file sequentially, generate MolecularDatapoints, then create a Dataset and DataLoader, and finally train the model. One of the challenges I face is ensuring the data is shuffled after completing each training epoch. To address this, I found that `torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` is a useful class for my needs."
